      <h2>Content One</h2>
      <p>Golconda Fort (Urdu: “round hill”), (also known as Golla konda (Telugu: "shepherds' hill"), is a fortified citadel built by the Qutb Shahi dynasty (c. 1512–1687), located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds, known as the Golconda Diamonds. The region has produced some of the world's most famous diamonds, including the colourless Koh-i-Noor (now owned by the United Kingdom), the blue Hope (United States), the pink Daria-i-Noor (Iran), the white Regent (France), the Dresden Green (Germany), and the colourless Orlov (Russia), Nizam and Jacob (India), as well as the now lost diamonds Florentine Yellow, Akbar Shah and Great Mogul.</p>

      <h3>Content Two</h3>
      <p>It was initially called Shepherd’s Hill (Golla Konda in Telugu). According to legend, a shepherd boy came across an idol on this rocky hill. The information was conveyed to the ruling Kakatiya king, who constructed a mud fort around this holy spot. After 200 years, Bahamani rulers took possession of the fort. Under the Bahmani Sultanate, Golconda slowly rose to prominence. Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk (r. 1487–1543), sent by the Bahmanids as a governor at Golconda, established the city as the seat of his government around 1501. Bahmani rule gradually weakened during this period, and Sultan Quli (Quli Qutub Shah period) formally became independent in 1538, establishing the Qutb Shahi dynasty based in Golconda.[2][3] Over a period of 62 years, the mud fort was expanded by the first three Qutb Shahi sultans into the present structure, a massive fortification of granite extending around 5 km (3.1 mi) in circumference. It remained the capital of the Qutb Shahi dynasty until 1590 when the capital was shifted to Hyderabad. The Qutb Shahis expanded the fort, whose 7 km (4.3 mi) outer wall enclosed the city.</p>
